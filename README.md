[Weather Pal](https://lucasanderson.dev/) or React Weather is a sleek weather web app that displays all essential data on one page. It features

- hourly and daily weather for 14 days
- radar - 30 minute forecast and 2 hours in the past
- horizontal scroll
- current weather and observations
- current day's average temperature and records
- global location search
- autosuggestions
- hourly-updated weather
- metric & imperial units
- weather react-icons (mostly bootstrap's)
- accurate timezones.

The API used for current weather and forecasting is [Visual Crossing Weather](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) (free 1000 requests/day).

Leaflet is used for the mapping library and [Rainviewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/api/weather-maps-api.html) for the precipitation layers.

Location autosuggestions and geocoding are provided by [GeoDB](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities) and [MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/)
