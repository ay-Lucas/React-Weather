# React-Weather

A sleek weather app that displays all essential data on one page. It will feature an interactive map where various data overlays and radar can be applied.
It will be using multiple APIs such as OpenMeteo for forecasting, RainViewer for radar, and Leaflet for mapping.

More than a basic OpenWeatherMap API app!
