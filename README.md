# React-Weather -> A work in progress.

A sleek weather app that will feature an interactive map where various data overlays can be toggled.
It will be using multiple APIs such as OpenMeteo for forecasting, RainViewer for radar, and Leaflet for mapping.

More than a basic OpenWeatherMap API app!
(First React Project)
