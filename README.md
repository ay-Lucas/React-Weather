# Weather Pal

A sleek weather web app that displays all essential data on one page. It features

- hourly and daily weather for up to 15 days
- hourly-updated current weather
- global location search
- autosuggestions
- metric & imperial units
- accurate timezones.
- weather react-icons (mostly bootstrap's)

The API used for current weather and forecasting is [Visual Crossing Weather](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) (free 1000 requests/day).

Location autosuggestions and geocoding are provided by [GeoDB](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)

Radar and interactive maps with various data overlays coming soon. I will likely use RainViewer for radar and Leaflet for mapping, but the source for overlays is undeterminded so far.

Additionally, **Weather Pal** will be hosted on Vercel in the near future.

More than a basic OpenWeatherMap app!
